This is a school level 11th grade project using python . In this I have demonstrated a  Restaurant named "Pulkit Eatries" in which you have to sign in/up. After a basic authentication, user is showed a menu with prices listed. User can pick items with quantity of choice. Since I have not utilized any database/auth service this project used fake random data. At last the user is given a reciept.
